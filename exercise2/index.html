	<p class="p1"><big>KRATOS</big><br>
	Enough! Why palter? Why wast idle pity?<br>
	Is not the God Gods loathe hateful to thee?<br>
	Traitor to man of thy prerogative?
	</p>

	<p><big>HEPHAESTUS</big><br>
	Kindred and fellowship are dreaded names.
	</p>

	<p class="p2 column1"><big>KRATOS<br>
	Questionless; but to slight the Father's word- <br>
	How sayest thou? Is not this fraught with more dread?
	</p>

	<p class="column2">HEPHAESTUS<br>
	Thy heart was ever hard and overbold.
	</p>

	<p class="p1">KRATOS<br>
	But wailing will not ease him! Waste no pains <br>
	Where thy endeavour nothing profiteth.
	</p>

	<p>HEPHAESTUS<br>
	Oh execrable work! O handicraft!
	</p>

	<p class="p1 column">KRATOS<br>
	Why curse thy trade? For what thou hast to do, <br>
	Troth, smithcraft is in no wise answerable.
	</p>

	<p>HEPHAESTUS<br>
	Would that it were another's craft, not mine!
	</p>

	<p class="p1">KRATOS<br>
	Why, all things are a burden save to rule <br>
	Over the Gods; for none is free but Zeus.
